# Manual ML examples converted to PyCaret equivalent workflows

This repository contains examples of publicly available machine learning analyses that have been converted to a low code PyCaret equivalent flow.
The goal of this repository is to show how users can 
1.	Convert their high code manual flow into a low code flow that is easier to understand and follow.
2.	Create an experiment environment where models from several libraries (with different coding syntax and styles) can be compared in a consistent manner.
3.	Automate manual workflows.
